0) Install 'react-router-dom' & Import & wrap <App/> with <BrowserRouter>

1) Make Component Hierarchy: -To know what should be a component follow "single responsibility principle"
-App
-BookList
 -Bookshelves
  -Bookshelf
   -Book
   -Bookshelf Changer
 -Add Book Button

 -Search Page
  -Search Bar
  -Search Results
   -Book
    -Book Options

2) Build a static version: Split the UI into BookList & BookSearch
**Use route instead of state & Use <Link> instead of "a tags or buttons"  and take care of button styles


3) Determine the data in app:
    a) Books =>  state***
    b) Bookshelves =>  not state
       Bookshelf => not state
    c) Book => not state
    d) Bookshelf Changer => state***
    e) AddButton => not state
    f) Search Input => state***


4) Identify where state should live

Books => {BookList & Bookshelves & Book }  -Will live in {BookList}

Bookshelf Changer => {Bookshelves}

Search input => {SearchBar}

5) USE BookAPI.getAll(): to get all books in the App, and make an array of objects for bookshelves
